# Reinforcement Learning Preparation – Weekly Assignments

## What I Learned (in Short)
In these weeks, I learned the basics of Machine Learning and Reinforcement
Learning. I understood how data is processed, how models are trained, and
how decisions can be made using values and policies. These concepts are
important for my long-term goal of building a program that can learn to
play the Flappy Bird game.

## Summary of Week 1, Week 2, and Week 3

### Week 1 – Machine Learning Basics
In Week 1, I worked with the Titanic dataset using Python. I learned how to
load and clean data, handle missing values, and encode categorical features.
I implemented Linear Regression to predict ticket fare and Logistic
Regression to predict survival. I also learned how to evaluate models
using metrics like MSE, R², accuracy, precision, and recall, and how to
visualize data using plots and confusion matrices.

### Week 2 – Neural Networks with PyTorch
In Week 2, I started learning neural networks using PyTorch. I implemented
a simple linear classifier using `torch.nn.Linear` and understood how the
forward pass and backpropagation work using toy data. I also built a
feedforward neural network with two hidden layers and trained it on the
MNIST dataset using ReLU activation, CrossEntropyLoss, and the Adam
optimizer.

### Week 3 – Markov Decision Processes
In Week 3, I learned about Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and how
reinforcement learning problems are formulated. I implemented a simple
5x5 Gridworld environment and applied Value Iteration and Policy Iteration
to compute state values and policies. This helped me understand how an
agent learns optimal behavior using rewards and value functions.

## Problems Faced by me 
-Understanding the difference between regression and classification in the beginning was confusing.
-Encoding and scaling data correctly took some trial and error.
-In PyTorch, understanding how tensors, loss functions, and gradients work required practice.While implementing MDPs,it was difficult at first to understand how value updates and policies work together, but writing the code step by
step helped.


## Conclusion
These three weeks helped me build a strong foundation in machine learning
and reinforcement learning. Although there were some difficulties as a
beginner, implementing the concepts in code made them much clearer and
prepared me for more advanced reinforcement learning tasks.
